Given the recent interest in [progressive web
apps](https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/),
this project investigates whether it is feasible to automatically port some
[Chrome Apps](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps) to web sites that
run offline in Chrome and other modern browsers.  This code is extremely
experimental and not intended for real-world use.

## Installation

Extract the code into a folder. Install dependencies with pip and npm:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt && npm install

## Disclaimer

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just
code that happens to be owned by Google.
